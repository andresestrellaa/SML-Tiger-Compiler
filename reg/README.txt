To test, run "sml < a" at the shell. This compiles "k1.tig",
producing "k1.tig.s" and printing a variety of output. Note that

user-compiled code is at the label "tig_main".

Notes:
+ We are turning this assignment in one day late.

+ We have completed this portion of the assignment, and to our knowledge it
	fulfills all requirements laid out in Appel and in class.

+ Appel's given canon.sml produces numerous "match nonexhaustive" warnings.
	To our knowledge, these do not affect the correctness of our compiler.
